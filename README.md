# ultraleap-for-max
 A Max object for using Ultraleap Leap Motion with Apple Silicon computers
 
 Requires latest Ultraleap Software installed, which will add the SDK files to Application Support or the Application bundle. It took some fiddling around to get XCode to recognize the Ultraleap includes and libs, so I'm including my xcodeproj file here for reference.
